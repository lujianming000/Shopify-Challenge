Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). 
When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. 
Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

a.	Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
Answer: 
The reason why the answer is $3145.13 is that we only take the average of all order amounts. If the total items of some orders are large, 
the order amount will be very large for those orders. The average will go up for sure because of those orders. 
The good thing is that we can find the problem because of this large average, so we can know the method is wrong. 
My solution is to create a new column to get the average price for each order. Since every store only sells one model of shoe. 
That is also the sneaker price for each store. To do that is just using order amounts divided by total items. After that, 
we can take the average for the sneaker price of each order this month, then we will get the right answer ($387.74). 
However, if we sort the sneaker price we will found one store sell a very expensive shoe, which is about $25,725. It will significantly affect AOV. 
If we take them out, the answer would be $152.48, which is a reasonable price.

b.	What metric would you report for this dataset?
Answer:
•	Sneaker price at each store
•	Total items sell for 100 stores 
•	Total items sell for each store
•	The total amount for 100 stores
•	The total amount for each store
•	Total cash sell, Total debit card sell, Total credit card sell for 100 shops
•	Total cash sell, Total debit card sell, Total credit card sell for each store.
•	Percentage of cash sell, debit card sell, credit card sell for 100 shops
•	Percentage of cash sell, debit card sell, credit card sell for each shop
•	Total amount ordered for each user
•	Total item sell for each user

c.	What is its value?
Answer:
$387.74 or $152.48
